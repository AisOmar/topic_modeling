#  Telecom Service That Uses Intelligent Assistant For Making All Its Agents Experts from day one

###  Background Story
Agents often have to handle multiple chats at the same time during rush hours. This makes the task of satisfying the customers' needs and closing the sale considerably harder since the agents have to divide their time and attent.

### Questions
I need to analyze chat data to understand:
1. Why and how often are customers chatting in?
2. What types of products are customers trying to buy or upgrade?
3. How often are sales made in the dataset?
4. Are there any trends from the agent messages leading up to sales?
5. What are some interesting insights from the conversations.
